# Anime-Face-Generation-GANs

An application of Generative Adversarial Networks using PyTorch library to generate Anime Faces with an unsupervised learning using GANs. With the use of various data processing techniques we can achieve fairly good results in Anime dataset after a mere 25 epochs. Although generating real human faces requires learning of a lot more features than an Anime Face, but can be trained following a similar training model and technique.
